**Task force 1.1 (ASL software inventory)** prepared a draft of a comprehensive grading system that will allow the pipeline users to grade pipelines based on their features, performance, but also ease of use and availability of support. The next step is to define the testing datasets and find volunteers to perform the testing.

**Task force 1.2 (DCE/DSC software inventory)** drafted a definition of the expert review process and criteria to ensure a consistent and transparent review process, including number of expert reviewers per tool, review criteria, means of reporting, anonymity, author response processes, etc.

**Task force 2.2 (ASL code repository)** performed a verification on the code snippets in the toolbox to test that the code runs and produces expected output. Results are reported [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19rpABTISIH5cT_dzQhw4Fzl0_387ytgd/edit).

**Task force 3.2 (Data sharing)** has prepared a draft of "recommendations of best practices for sharing perfusion data" in which the best practices and actionable guidelines for researchers, who plan to share perfusion data publicly, are provided. Feedback from the community is encouraged and appreciated! The link to the document is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11ccfuvM3WrQiabm3pyPwDHfcMv5V595NC689bXJJ1Xk/edit?usp=sharing)
