**Wrap up of 1st two-year roadmap** 

The first two-year roadmap has officially come to an end! 
The Taskforces are currently finalizing the manuscripts for MRM submission

**Recap of ISMRM**
The ISMRM provided a good opportunity to show all the work that has been done in the past two years!
Five abstracts were presented at ISMRM! If you've missed out the talks or poster discussions, here is the link to the abstracts. 

[to do where to put link to abstracts?]

Here is some great feedback we got:
- "The more I learn about OSIPI, the more impressed I am"
- "OSIPI should be more involved with the Reproducibility Research Study Group"
- "the Reproducibility research study group typically hosts challenges as well, can future OSIPI challenges be broadcasted earlier through the RRSG?"
- "OSIPI needed more time during the study group for both updates and potential discussion"
- When we submit consensus profiles (e.g. lexicons) we should ask MRM to require/"heavily encourage" future perfusion publications to use this lexicon. Maybe start off submitting as supplemental material?
- "The structure of OSIPI is general to implement other initiatives. Would OSIPI consider branching out of perfusion?"  
- "Maybe next year a MIS on open science initiatives?" 
- How can we ask for a bit of funding to support open source/open science work which then can be integrated into OSIPI? 
- Integrating OSIPI into QIBA profiles -- specifically an upcoming DCE update
- Literature inventory -- specifically with perfusion publications highlight repeatability and reproducibility 

[to do check with Laura what is feedback and what are own ideas?]
