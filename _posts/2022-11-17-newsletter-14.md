**Get involved in the next phase of OSIPI** 

If you want to help improve the reproducibility of MRI perfusion research, look no further. 
The Open Science Initiative for Perfusion Imaging (OSIPI) is an MRI perfusion community that creates open access code and data resources, harmonizes acquisition and processing nomenclature, organizes challenges, and will work on teaching. 
The first roadmap (2020-2022) was quite successful with 7 manuscripts ready for submission to MRM. 

We are now creating the next OSIPI roadmap (2023-2025), for which we are looking for new members.
Even if you have only a little bit of time, your efforts are very much welcome! 
If you have experience with perfusion MRI or are a research software engineer with an interest in open science projects, please consider joining us for the next roadmap. We are open for researchers at all stages of their careers. 
Please visit www.osipi.org or e-mail us for more information; also when you’re just exploring your options.

Looking forward to welcoming those with OSIPI DNA!


Best wishes,

The OSIPI [Executive & Management Board](https://www.osipi.org/emb/)
