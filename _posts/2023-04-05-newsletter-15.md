**Start of the second Roadmap** 

In February 2023 we started with our second [roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQqOATrWE2COIXq4qTkEe1Bix26GVr_-YTKUJbevCPXXFJf_nMKH3_Nw3DMsY2BcZHPKBG3EOg4SU4r/pub). 
In the coming two years we will build further on the successes of the first roadmap.
The general aim is to  make the resources more accessible and user-friendly and/or extend them to non-brain and non-human applications.
Three new taskforces have started:
- TF2.4 IVIM code library: set-up a code library for intravoxel-incoherent motion imaging (IVIM)
- TF5.1 Website and technical support: improve user experience of OSIPIs website
- TF5.2 Education: create educational resources for learning scientists and clinicians

**Redesign of our website**

Our website will move and be redesigned to improve user experience. 
So www.osipi.org will not be maintained at the moment. Please stay tuned for updates!

**Get involved in the next phase of OSIPI** 

With the start of the new roadmap, it is a good moment to join us on this adventure and expand your network within this motivating and inclusive community. Even if you have only a little bit of time, your expertise and efforts are very much welcome!

Each task force (TF) summarized what they will work on and what expertise they are looking for. 
Please have a look [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQcAZ5g5WMoseq36-zSTXoV--kMdC4AyvPmbtx3vMS6_293NT9N2pmI9rli4QSfxqXg5j3kb_vUu5H_/pub ) and contact us if you are interested!
