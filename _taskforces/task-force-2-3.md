title: "OSIPI Task Force 2.3: DCE/DSC contributions"
aims: Collect, validate and harmonise DCE/DSC code snippets from developers
description: |
  Task force 2.3 aims to collect, test and share open-source perfusion imaging code for use in research and software development. Code contributions can include modules covering one or more steps within the image processing pipeline, for example T1 mapping, converting signal to concentration and pharmacokinetic modelling. A further aim of OSIPI is to develop a fully tested and harmonised code library, drawing on the contributions within this repository. 
  
  **Note that most Taskforce 2.3 activity is now taking place in our public [DSC-/DCE-MRI Python code repository](https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection) on Github. Please visit the repository [wiki](https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection/wiki) for detailed information.**
  
  Please contact the leads if you are interested in joining the taskforce or in contributing code.
